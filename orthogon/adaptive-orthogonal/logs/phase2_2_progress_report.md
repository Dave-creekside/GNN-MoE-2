## 🧪 **Technical Innovations**

### **1. Intelligent Specialization Monitoring**
```python
def compute_specialization_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Real-time expert specialization computation with robust error handling"""
    - Handles different weight matrix dimensions via padding
    - Uses torch.no_grad() for efficient metric computation
    - Provides per-layer and overall specialization scores
    - Includes fallback mechanisms for edge cases
```

### **2. Multi-Factor Adaptive Strength Computation**
```python
adaptive_strength = base_strength * time_factor * performance_factor * emergency_factor

Where:
- time_factor: Cosine/exponential/linear decay schedules
- performance_factor: 1.5x boost if below target, 0.7x reduction if above
- emergency_factor: 2.0x+ boost during expert collapse detection
```

### **3. Emergency Intervention System**
```python
def detect_expert_collapse(self) -> bool:
    """Sophisticated expert collapse detection"""
    - Monitors recent specialization score trends
    - Detects rapid negative trajectory in expert differentiation
    - Triggers emergency constraint boost to prevent collapse
    - Provides detailed logging of intervention events
```

### **4. Layer-Specific Adaptation**
```python
def _initialize_layer_strengths(self):
    """Deeper layers get reduced constraints (more specialized)"""
    layer_factor = self.config.deeper_layer_scaling ** layer_idx
    strength = base_strength * layer_factor
    # Results in: [0.150, 0.112, 0.084] for 3-layer model
```
