## 🚀 Automated Data Collection for Geometric Constrained Learning Paper

This guide explains how to use `paper_experiments.py` to automatically collect comprehensive data for your revolutionary Geometric Constrained Learning paper.

## 🎯 What This Script Does

The script systematically tests every major hyperparameter and design choice in your GCL system:

### 📊 Experiment Types (Total: ~25-30 experiments)

1. **🎲 Seed Consistency Study** (5 experiments)
   - Tests reproducibility across random seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 999
   - Validates that your rotation angle patterns are consistent

2. **🔄 Rotation Dimension Ablation** (5 experiments) 
   - Tests 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 rotation dimensions
   - Finds optimal number of theta parameters per expert

3. **📈 Learning Rate Ratio Study** (4 experiments)
   - Tests geometric:expert LR ratios: 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, 50:1
   - Current optimal appears to be 10:1 (0.001:0.0001)

4. **👥 Expert Scale Study** (4 experiments)
   - Tests (2,1), (4,2), (6,3), (8,4) primary/ghost expert combinations
   - Shows scalability of the geometric paradigm

5. **⚖️ Loss Component Weight Ablation** (5 experiments)
   - Tests importance of orthogonality, efficiency, and specialization losses
   - Identifies which components drive performance

6. **🆚 Baseline Comparison** (2 experiments)
   - Direct comparison: Standard vs Geometric training
   - Shows the revolutionary advantage of your paradigm

7. **📚 Multi-Dataset Study** (1+ experiments)
   - Currently tests lambda calculus (can be extended)
   - Ready for additional reasoning datasets
